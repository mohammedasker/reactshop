React shop storyline:

1. I can see the item lists in the main page [x]
2. I can add the item to the cart []
3. I can add multiple items to the cart []
4. I can go to check out page and view my selected items []
5. I can add/remove number of items in the check out page []
6. When the item number reached zero, it should be completely removed from my cart []
7. I can still see my cart items when I refresh the page []
8. When I clicked the checkout button, my cart should be empty []
